### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Profile!

Iâ€™m Yetunde Morenikeji, a Senior Frontend Developer and Technical Writer with 5+ years of experience crafting modern, high-performing, and user-focused web applications.

I specialize in turning complex ideas into intuitive, elegant, and accessible user experiences â€” from creating custom UI components to simplifying challenging UX flows for maximum clarity and engagement.

My focus is always on what the end-user sees and feels: smooth interactions, fast performance, and interfaces that feel natural to use. Whether Iâ€™m designing from scratch or optimizing existing systems, I bring both precision in code and care in design to deliver results clients are proud to launch.

What I bring to the table:

Custom, reusable components tailored to business needs â€” not cookie-cutter templates

Streamlined UX flows that make even complex features feel effortless

Pixel-perfect UI implementation that remains consistent across devices

Scalable, maintainable architecture for long-term product growth
Clear technical documentation to help teams and clients work more efficiently

Tech Stack & Tools I Work With
React.js | Next.js | TypeScript | JavaScript | TailwindCSS | CSS3 | HTML5 | Bootstrap | Node.js (basic) | Firebase | MongoDB | SQLite | Framer Motion | Web Sockets

ðŸ’¼ Open to collaborations, consulting, and contract roles â€” especially projects where UI/UX quality is a priority.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m convinced that great design and good food share the same rule â€” presentation matters.
